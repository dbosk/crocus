\subsection{\Acl*{DB} protocols}%
\label{distance-bounding}

\Ac{DB} protocols were first suggested by \citet{DistanceBounding} to prevent relay attacks in contactless communications in which the adversary forwards a communication between a prover and a possibly far-away verifier to authenticate. 
These attacks cannot be prevented by cryptographic means as they are independent of the semantics of the messages exchanged.
As a consequence, mechanisms ensuring the physical proximity between a verifier and a prover should be used instead.
\Ac{DB} protocols precisely enable the verifier to estimate an upper bound on his distance to the prover by measuring the time-of-flight of short challenge-response messages (or rounds) exchanged during time-critical phases. 
Time critical phases are complemented by slow phases during which the time is not taking into account. 
At the end of a \Ac{DB} protocol, the verifier should be able to determine if the prover is legitimate \emph{and} in his vicinity.
In this sense, \Ac{DB} protocols combine the classical properties of authentication protocols with the possibility of verifying the physical proximity.

There are four adversaries for \ac{DB} protocols established in the literature, 
each of which tries to commit a type of fraud.
These can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \Acf{DBDF}: a legitimate but malicious prover wants to fool the verifier on the distance between them.
  \item \Acf{DBMF}: the adversary illegitimately authenticates using a, 
    possibly honest, prover who is far away from the verifier.
    (Also known as relaying attack or man-in-the-middle attack.)
  \item \Acf{DBTF}: a legitimate, but malicious, prover helps an accomplice, 
    who is close to the verifier, to authenticate.
    \Ac{DBTF} resistance is a very strong property; it implies that if the 
    accomplice succeeds (with non-negligible probability) he will learn the 
    prover's secret key\footnote{%
      This means that even things like functional encryption will not help.
    }.
  \item \Acf{DBDH}: similar to \ac{DBDF}, the malicious prover is far away but 
    uses an unsuspecting honest prover close to the verifier to pass as being 
    close.
    (This is different from \ac{DBMF} in that the honest prover actually tries 
    to authenticate to the verifier, but the malicious prover hijacks the 
    channel at some point(s) during the protocol.)
\end{itemize}

The majority of the existing \ac{DB} protocols are symmetric and thus require an honest verifier.
In this context it does not make sense to protect against the verifier as he 
can easily impersonate the prover as he has a knowledge of his secret key.
There has been less work done in the domain of asymmetric (or public-key) \ac{DB} protocols.
We will work in the latter setting; with a \emph{malicious verifier} who will 
potentially try to \emph{impersonate the prover} after successful verification.

\subsection{\Acl*{DB} security definitions}%
\label{DB-definitions}

There are two lines of attempts at formalizing the above properties: one by 
\citet{DB-BMV} and another by \citet{DB-DFKO}.
We will use the framework of \citeauthor{DB-DFKO} with extensions by 
\textcite{FormalTerroristFraud} and \textcite{TREAD} (definitions in 
\cref{DB-definitions}).
