\subsection{Distance-bounding protocols}%
\label{distance-bounding}


Our setting requires a public-key \ac{DB} protocol with a \emph{malicious verifier} who will potentially try to \emph{impersonate the prover}.
The verifier might also try to track the provers and map their identities to their actions, thus we also require privacy.
This leads to the requirement of a \ac{DB} \ac{ZKPK}, or simply \ac{PPK}, with resistance to all the frauds mentioned above as well as against a verifier who will attempt to impersonate the prover.
More specifically, we must combine such \iac{PPK} protocol with anonymous 
credentials.
The choice of the anonymous-credential system affects the properties we 
require of the \ac{PPK}, in particular, for the suggested instantiation it must 
be \iac{PPK} for discrete logarithms.
For this paper, we assume the existence of such a protocol. Candidates for such a protocol include modifications of ~\cite{ProProx} or \cite{PROPS} to work for discrete logarithm and to provide general attribute-based anonymous credentials (not restricted to identity-based ones), respectively.
