\section{System and adversary model}%
\label{system-model}

We will now describe our system and adversary models.
We first present an abstraction of a protest and how to count the participation 
(\cref{protest-model}).
Next we present the communication and adversary model (\cref{adversary-model}).
Finally, we present the desired security properties 
(\cref{security-properties}).
