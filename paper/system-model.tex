\section{System and adversary model}%
\label{system-model}

We will now describe our system and adversary models.
We first present an abstraction of a protest and how to count the participation 
(\cref{protest-model}) and the desired verifiabiltiy properties 
(\cref{verifiability-properties}).
Next, we present the communication and adversary model (\cref{adversary-model}) 
together with the desired privacy properties (\cref{privacy-properties}).
