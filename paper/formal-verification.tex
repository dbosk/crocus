\section{Formal Verification}

We formally verify the protocol security properties using the Tamarin
prover~\cite{meier2013tamarin}. Tamarin does not originally include
the possibility to reason on time and space in its model.  However,
thanks to a recent work by \textcite{TamarinDB}, the common properties
can be equivalently characterized with a causality-based definition
relying only on the order of messages.

The whole Tamarin code we wrote is provided in \cref{apdx:tamarin-spec}, with a short discussion of the modeling choices we made. 
It contains a specification of the distance-bounding protocol described previously, a definition of the soundness and correctness properties that ensure the protocol actually produces the expected result, and a definition of the security properties we want to ensure.

Tamarin's auto-prover validated the soundness and correctness
properties (in negligible computation time) and proved the security
properties used in~\cite{TamarinDB}. In the meantime,
\textcite{TamarinDBTF} introduced the notion of post-collusion
security which enabled them to prove \ac{DBTF}. In future work, we
will use this extension on our protocol.
