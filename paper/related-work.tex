One protocol exists in the literature that provides \acp{PPK} with most of the 
desired properties described previously, ProProx~\cite{ProProx}\footnote{Note 
  that~\cite{ProProx} uses the abbreviation PoPoK, we prefer \acs{PPK} for 
  shorter notation.}.
ProProx is secure against a malicious verifier, but it provides \iac{PPK} protocol for quadratic residues (\ie protocols of the form \(\PPK[\alpha][a = 
  \alpha^2]\)), while in our context, we need \iac{PPK} protocol for discrete 
logarithms (\ie \(\PPK[\alpha][a = g^\alpha]\), see \cref{ZK-anon-cred} for 
details).
