\subsection{System, communication and adversary model}%
\label{adversary-model}

We provide one system model with two possible adversaries: one who tries to 
link a protester's real identity (\(P\)) to a protest cause (\(\cid\)) and one 
which tries to link a protester's or a witness's real identity (\(P\) 
respectively \(W\)) to a location (\(l\)).
We also define varying strengths of each adversary.

\paragraph{The identity--cause linking adversary}

There are three players: the protest participant (with identity) \(P\), a 
witness (with identity) \(W\) and the storage \(S\).
The adversary \(A\) controls \(W\) and \(S\).

\begin{definition}[Base identity--cause adversary]%
  \label{base-identity-cause-adversary}
  The protester \(P\) and the witness \(W\) communicate.
  Each learn only the protocol data \(d_{P,W}(\cid, P)\) and when it happened 
  \(t_{P,W}\)\footnote{%
    Specifically, they do \emph{not} learn the real identities \(P\) and \(W\) 
    directly, only if those appear in the data \(d_{P,W}(\cid, P)\).
  }.
  The protester \(P\) communicates with \(S\), where \(S\) only learns 
  \(f(d_{P,W}(\cid, P))\), for some function \(f\), and the time of the 
  communication (\(t_{P,S}\)) but not the real identities.
  The adversary controls \(W\) and \(S\) and thus learns everything that they 
  do, but can additionally correlate what he learns from \(W\) and \(S\).
  The adversary wins if he can link \(\cid\) and \(P\).
\end{definition}

This definition is illustrated in \cref{fig:identity-cause-adversary}.

\begin{figure}

  \caption{\label{fig:identity-cause-adversary}%
    An overview of the base identity--cause adversary model.
    The protester with real identity \(P\) and witness with real identity \(W\) 
    communicate and each learn only the protocol data, \(d_{P,W}(\cid, P)\), 
    and the time it happened, \(t_{P,W}\).
    The protester submits \(f(d_{P,W}(\cid, P))\), for some function \(f\), to 
    the storage \(S\), who learns only that and the time it happened, 
    \(t_{P,S}\).
    Both the witness \(W\) and storage \(S\) are controlled by the adversary 
    \(A\).
  }
\end{figure}

We find \cref{base-identity-cause-adversary} suitable when the protester and 
witness both move in a crowd and there is no way for the witness to decide 
exactly with whom he or she communicates with.
However, in some situations this might not be the case, \eg the crowd is not 
dense.
In these situations the witness will likely see the face of the protester.
We capture this by the following definition.

\begin{definition}[Stonger identity--cause adversary]%
  \label{stronger-identity-cause-adversary}
  The situation is the same as in \cref{base-identity-cause-adversary}, but now the 
  witness \(W\) learns the protester \(P\)'s identity.
  (\(P\) will also learn \(W\)'s identity.)
  However, \(S\) still does not learn \(P\)'s identity.
\end{definition}

One reason to not allow \(S\) to learn \(P\)'s identity is that for this 
communication \(P\) has options, such as \ac{Tor}, for anonymous communication.
However, given a strong enough adversary, such anonymous communication might 
not be possible.
We capture such a strong adversary in the following definition.

\begin{definition}[Strongest identity--cause adversary]%
  \label{strongest-identity-cause-adversary}
  Everything is the same as in \cref{stronger-identity-cause-adversary}, except 
  that now \(S\) also learns \(P\)'s identity.
\end{definition}

\paragraph{The identity--location adversary}

The players are still the same, but now the adversary controls other players: 
in particular, the adversary controls only the storage \(S\).

\begin{definition}[Base identity--location adversary]%
  \label{base-identity-location-adversary}
  The adversary controls \(S\).
  The witness \(W\) and the protester \(P\) communicate.
  They learn some protocol data \(d_{P,W}(P, W, l)\) and the time it took 
  place, \(t_{P,W}\).
  \begin{description}
    \item[The witness case:]
      The witness later communicates with \(S\), where \(S\) only learns 
      \(f(d_{P,W}(P, W, l))\), for some function \(f\), and the time it 
      happened, \(t_{W,S}\).
      The adversary wins if he can link \(W\) and \(l\).
    \item[The protester case:]
      The protester later communicates with \(S\), where \(S\) only learns 
      \(g(d_{P,W}(P, W, l))\), for some function \(g\), and the time it 
      happened, \(t_{P,S}\).
      The adversary wins if he can link \(P\) and \(l\).
  \end{description}
\end{definition}

\Cref{fig:identity-location-adversary} illustrates the roles and relations.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{base-identity-location-adversary.tikz}
  \caption{\label{fig:identity-location-adversary}%
    An overview of the base identity--location adversary model.
    The protester with real identity \(P\) and witness with real identity \(W\) 
    communicate and each learn only the protocol data, \(d_{P,W}(P, W, l)\), 
    and the time it happened, \(t_{P,W}\).
    The witness submits \(f(d_{P,W}(P, W, l))\), for some function \(f\), and 
    the protester submits \(g(d_{P,W}(P, W, l))\), for some function \(g\), to 
    the storage \(S\), who learns only that and the time it happened, 
    \(t_{W,S}\) respectively \(t_{P,S}\).
    Only the storage \(S\) is controlled by the adversary \(A\).
  }
\end{figure}

The base rationale is the same as for \cref{base-identity-cause-adversary}, the 
witness \(W\) can submit to \(S\) over an anonymous channel, such as \ac{Tor}.
Anyone who is in the same location will learn that \(W\) was present, we want 
to prevent anyone \emph{not present} to learn that \(W\) was there --- hence we 
do not consider the protester as part of the adversary, only \(S\).
Analogous to the identity--cause adversary, we conclude with the strongest 
identity--location adversary.

\begin{definition}[Strongest identity--location adversary]%
  \label{strongest-identity-location-adversary}
  Things are the same as in \cref{base-identity-location-adversary}, except 
  that \(S\) learns the witness' and protester's identities \(W\) and \(P\), in 
  the respective cases.
\end{definition}
