  Crowd counts vary according to who is doing the counting and what
  methods and criteria they use. Current methods have wide margins for
  error, are difficult to verify, and can be privacy-invasive. We
  recognize the potential adversarial setting for crowd counts and
  thus aim for both transparency (in the form of verifiability) and
  privacy. In this paper we propose \CROCUS, a decentralized system
  based on smartphones that combines anonymous credentials, witnesses
  of proximity, and storage of participation proofs on a public ledger (\eg blockchain) to
  achieve properties similar to those needed for electronic voting,
  where, put simply, it is important to count everyone, but only once, not leak
  private information, and be able to prove that the count was done
  correctly. We find that, with some assumptions about the
  availability of future technology such as distance-bounding chips on
  smartphones, \CROCUS can provide the desired properties at
  acceptable performance.  
% The problem of participation estimation is a fundamental democratic issue in 
% the context of physical protests or demonstrations.  There, the number of 
% participants reflects the strength of the support or at least the interest of 
% the society in the topic of the protest.
% % Why is it a problem?
% Current methods for crowd counting have wide margins for error in addition to 
% being privacy-invasive.
% Moreover, the organizers of a protest may be tempted to cheat by inflating the 
% number of participants as much as possible whereas it is in the other parties' 
% interest to do the opposite if the protest is directed against it.                                                                                  
% % What's the approach?
% In this paper, we propose a novel approach to this problem, called \CROCUS, which combines location proofs (using distance-bounding anonymous credentials) with some properties of electronic voting to provide verifiable yet privacy-preserving participation estimation.
% Since parties have incentives to cheat, transparency is a fundamental requirement that we achieve through a decentralized scheme providing both verifiability and privacy.
% More specifically, the proposed scheme is distributed, does not depend on any authority and it must scale to handle large protests (\ie millions of participants).
% In \CROCUS, each participant creates a participation proof with the collaboration of other participants, called witnesses, in a privacy-preserving manner (\ie without requiring to reveal their own identity or that of witnesses).
% %Seb: verify in the mention of the blockchain is coherent with the rest of the paper
% A public ledger is then used to commit and timestamp the participation proofs, which essentially consist of location proofs in which a privacy-preserving distance-bounding protocol is used by participants to prove their proximity to witnesses.
% % What's the result?
% Our scheme provides individual verifiability, which means that each participant 
% can verify that their participation has been included in the final count --- to 
% prevent the regime in place from dropping data --- and universal and 
% eligibility verifiability, in the sense that anyone can verify the correctness 
% of the result, to prevent any malicious actor (\eg Sybil attack) from affecting 
% the result. 
%Seb: we need to be careful about how we formulate the following sentence
%Our scheme provides these verifiability properties in a privacy-preserving manner in the sense that it adds no risk to a participant that was not already present when not using our scheme.
