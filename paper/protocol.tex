\section{The \CROCUS Protocol}
\label{Protocol}


We now present \CROCUS, a protocol for privately verifiable crowd counts.
The protocol consists of three phases:
before the protest, with the setup and registration steps (\cref{ProtocolSetup});
during the protest, with the creation, join, participation, and submission 
steps (\cref{ProtocolDuring});
and after the protest, with the verification step (in
\cref{ProtocolVerification}). 
%Note that some of the figures with
%protocol minutiae from related work are in~\cref{anon-cred-figures}.

Several entities are involved in our protocol.
First, a \emph{certificate authority} (\ac{CA}) is responsible for certifying a one-to-one mapping between a 
person's identity and a cryptographic key
%\footnote{%
%  This can be done by a centralized authority, such as a nation state with, 
%  \eg, passports; or a decentralized authority, as in the case of a a 
%  collective authority~\cite{collective-signing} powered by 
%  proof-of-personhood~\cite{proof-of-personhood}.
%}.
For simplicity, we assume that the \ac{CA} is a trusted third-party, but its role is only important to prevent Sybil attacks, so in practice we only need the \ac{CA} to not be aligned with the protesters. For instance, the role of the \ac{CA} can be assumed by a centralized authority, such as a nation state with, 
\eg, passports, and that would not impact the trust of a participation count for a protest \emph{against} this state. However, any pro-state demonstration in that context would be subject to Sybils. Another possibility would be to use a decentralized authority, as in the case of a 
collective authority~\cite{collective-signing} powered by 
proof-of-personhood~\cite{proof-of-personhood}.
The \ac{CA} is only involved in the setup phase.

Second, a participant is an individual who wants to participate in a given 
protest.
A participant can assume three different roles:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \emph{organizer} has written a manifesto for the protest and forwards it to others.
\item A \emph{protester} is attending the protest and asks witnesses to vouch 
  for their presence.
\item A \emph{witness} provides proofs to protesters which state that the 
  protester was indeed participating, constructed such that the proofs are verifiable by 
  third parties.
\end{enumerate}
In general, there is one organizer and every participant can act as
either or both protester and witness.

\subsection{Pre-protest phase}%
\label{ProtocolSetup}

The setup step is only run once and is the same as in Anon-Pass~\cite{AnonPass}.
More precisely, we have simply adapted their description to our notation, but otherwise kept the setting as similar as possible.


\emph{Setup: \((\spk, \ssk)\gets \CROCUSsetup\).}
During the setup phase, the \ac{CA} creates all the needed keys.
The \ac{CA} generates a service public-private key-pair \((\spk, \ssk)\gets 
  \ACsetup\) (see \cref{ACsignAlg}).

\emph{Registration: \(\sk\gets 
    \Proto{\CROCUSreg[_P][\spk]}{\CROCUSreg[_{\CA}][\ssk]}\).}
During the registration step, each participant generates a secret key and 
obtains a signature on it by the \ac{CA} but without revealing it to the 
\ac{CA}.
At the end, each participant will have a signed secret key while the \ac{CA} 
will issue only one signature per participant but without knowing the 
association between a particular key and the identity of the participant.
The participant chooses \(k, r\rgets \ZZ_q\) uniformly randomly and runs 
\(\sigma \gets \Proto{\ACgetSig[\spk, k, r]}{\ACissueSig[\spk, \ssk]}\) (see 
\cref{ACacAlg}).
Upon success, the participant sets \(\sk = (\sigma, k, r)\).

The setup and registration steps can be done once and the keys can be reused 
for an arbitrary number of protests.
Thus, the registration step could be easily integrated as part of the issuance 
of national identity cards, passports or \acp{eID}.

\subsection{Protest phase}%
\label{ProtocolDuring}


%The join, participation and submission phases are as follows.
% illustrated in \cref{fig:ProtocolOverview}.

The participation proof share constructed in the
participation phase is illustrated in \cref{fig:ProofFig}.

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics{proofshare.tikz}
  \caption{%
    Structure of a proof share.
    The protest (cause) identifier \(\cid\) is the hash value of the manifesto.
    The protester \(P\)'s identifier \(\pid\) is computed using the protester's key \(\sk_P\) and \(\cid\).
    The witness \(W\)'s protester-specific identifier \(\wid\) is computed using the
    witness's key \(\sk_W\) and the protester's \(\pid\).
    \(t_s, t_s'\) are the hashes of the head blocks in the ledger seen by the 
    protester and witness, respectively, and \(l\) is an area.
    All values are signed by the witness (signature \(\prf_W = \SPK[\sk_W][\wid 
      = \dotsb][\cid, \pid, \wid, t_s, t_s', l]\)) while also proving the 
    correctness of \(\wid\) and knowledge of a signature on \(\sk_W\).
    The protester constructs \(\prf_P\) analogously.
  }%
  \label{fig:ProofFig}
\end{figure}%


\emph{Creation of a protest: the manifesto.}
The organizer writes a manifesto for the protest, which describes its cause.
This manifesto could take the form of any intelligible text.
The organizer will then distribute this manifesto to people through
any suitable means  (\eg on the Web, on placards, \etc).
If they agree with the cause, they will use the knowledge of the
manifesto to join the protest. 


\emph{Joining as a protester: \((\pid, t_s)\gets 
    \CROCUSjoin[_P][\text{manifesto}]\).}
A protester who wants to join the protest will use the manifesto to
compute an identifier for the cause by hashing the manifesto,
\(\cid\gets \Hash[\mfst]\) (and comparing the result to that received
from the organizer, we omit this in the protocol for readibility).
Afterwards, this identifier is used to create the protest-specific identifier 
for the protester, \(\pid\gets \ACprf[_{\sk_P}][\cid]\) (see 
\cref{fig:ProofFig} and \cref{ACprfAlg}).
The protester should also receive a time-correlated random value from the 
time-stamping service, \(t_s\gets \TSget\).


\emph{Joining as a witness: \(t_s'\gets \CROCUSjoin_W\).}
The witness should simply get a time-correlated random value from the time-stamping service, \(t_s'\gets \TSget\).
Note that we do this for redundancy, the newest of \(t_s\) and \(t_s'\) will 
set the start of the time interval of creation for the proof share.


\emph{Participation: \(\pi\gets
    \Proto{\CROCUSparticipate[\cid, \sk_P]}{\CROCUSwitness[\sk_W, \spk]}\),}
In the participation phase, the protester and 
the witness construct the proof share of the protester (\cref{fig:ProofFig}).

The protester sends \(\pid\) to the witness.
Then they run the protocol \[
  \Proto{\ACproveSig[\spk, k, r, \sigma]}{\ACverifySig[\spk, \ssk]}
\] (see \cref{ACacAlg}).
Note that the \ac{PK} in \cref{ACacAlg} must be run as \iac{PPK}.
If the protocol succeeds, the witness will compute \(\wid \gets 
  \ACprf[_{\sk_W}][\pid]\) and send \((\wid, t_s', l)\) to the protester.


\emph{Submission: \(\psh_P\gets \CROCUSsubmit[_P][\cid, \pid, \wid, t_s, t_s',  l]\).}
The protester should as soon as possible commit the proof-share data to the 
time-stamping service and receive the proof of commitment, \(t_e\gets 
  \TSstamp[\Hash[\cid, \pid, \wid, t_s, t_s', l]]\).
The remaining operations are not time critical.

The protester computes \iac{NIZK} proof \(\corr_{\pid}\), which shows the 
correctness of \(\pid\).
More specifically,
\begin{multline*}
  \corr_{\pid}\gets \SPK\left\{ (\sk_P) : \right. \\
    \begin{aligned}
      \pid &= \ACprf[_{\sk_P}][\cid] \quad \land \\
      \sigma_P' &= \left. \ACblind[\ACsign[_{\ssk}][\sk_P]] \right\}
    \end{aligned} \\
      (\cid, \pid, \wid, t_s, t_s', l).
\end{multline*}
Finally, the protester uploads the tuple \[
  \psh_P = (\cid, \pid, \wid, t_s, t_s', t_e, l, \corr_{\pid})
\] for permanent storage.

\emph{Submission: \(\psh_W\gets \CROCUSsubmit[_W][\cid, \pid, \wid, t_s, t_s', 
    l]\).}
The witness should, just as the protester, commit the proof-share data to the 
time-stamping service, \(t_e'\gets \TSstamp[\Hash[\cid, \pid, \wid, t_s, t_s', 
  l]]\).
(This is to make the time interval as early as possible, whoever is the faster 
will submit it.)
Then, without any time requirements, the witness computes \iac{NIZK} proof 
\(\corr_{\wid}\) as follows:
\begin{multline*}
  \corr_{\wid}\gets \SPK\left\{ (\sk_W) : \right. \\
    \begin{aligned}
      \wid &= \ACprf[_{\sk_W}][\pid] \quad \land \\
      \sigma_W' &= \left. \ACblind[\ACsign[_{\ssk}][\sk_W]] \right\}
    \end{aligned} \\
      (\cid, \pid, \wid, t_s, t_s', l).
\end{multline*}
Finally, the witness uploads the tuple \[
  \psh_W = (\cid, \pid, \wid, t_s, t_s', t_e', l, \corr_{\wid})
\] for permanent storage.


Here is an overview of the protocol.

\subsection{Post-protest phase}%
\label{ProtocolVerification}

% While there are various ways for verifying the participation count, hereafter, 
% we will detail the two suggested just after \cref{DefParticipationCount}.
% In the first approach, we do not trust individual witnesses, rather we \emph{assume} that it is difficult for Alice to find more than \(\theta\) witnesses willing to collude.
% Thus, the strength comes from the number of witnesses and we require at least \(\theta\) witnesses to accept a participation proof as valid.
% In the second approach, we trust specific witnesses, but no others.
% In this case, to accept a participation proof as valid, we require at least one trusted witness, the independent journalist Jane.
% It is the strength function \(\str\) of \cref{DefParticipationCount} that 
% differ in the two cases.
% We will first give the procedure and then how to construct the two different 
% strength functions.


To verify the participation count for a protest \(\prtst\) with identifier \(cid_0\),
a verifier must download from the storage system S the set \(S_{\prtst}\) of all \(s_P\) and \(s_W\) tuples containing \(cid_0\).
Then from \(S_{\prtst}\), a verifier can build, in succession,
(a) the valid proof shares \(s_j^{(i)}\) for all matching pairs \((s_P,s_W)\) corresponding to a witness  \(i\) and a protester \(j\),
(b) the participation proof \(\prf_{j}\) for each protester \(j\),
(c) the set \(\prfs_{\prtst}^{\str,\theta}\) of eligible participation proofs for all protesters in \(P\),
 and finally the participation count, cardinality of the previous set.


More precisely, given: \\
\(S_{\prtst} = \{ (cid, pid, wid, l, t_s, t_s', t_c, \corr) \in \pshs \mid \cid = \cid_0 \} \) \\
and a matching pair \((s_P, s_W) \in {S_{\prtst}}^2\) for a witness \(i\) and a protester \(j\)
with \(s_P = (cid_0, pid_j, wid_i, l, t_s, t_s', t_c, \psi_i)\)
and  \(s_W = (cid_0, pid_j, wid_i, l, t_s, t_s', t_c', \psi_j)\),
%, with matching values for \(cid_0, pid_j, wid_i, l, t_s, t_s'\),
the verifier can build a valid proof share \(s_j^{(i)}\) certified by  \(i\) for \(j\) as follow:
verify \(\psi_i\) and \(\psi_j\),
let \(t = [max(t_s, t_s'), min(t_c, t_c')]\),
let \(s_j^{(i)} = (cid_0, pid_j, wid_i, l, t)\), as in \cref{DefProofShare},
check that \(s_j^{(i)}\) is valid (i.e. happened during and at the location of the protest), as in \cref{DefProofShare}.

Then the set of all valid proof shares for a protester \(j\) constitutes its participation proof \(\pi_{j}\), as in \cref{DefParticipationProof},
and the verifier thus can derive the set of \((\str,\theta)\)-eligible participation proofs \(\prfs_{\prtst}^{\str,\theta}\) for all protesters for the protest \(\prtst\), as in \cref{DefParticipationCount}.
Finally, the  participation count \(|\prfs_{\prtst}^{\str,\theta}|\) is the cardinality of this set by the same \cref{DefParticipationCount}.


% MOST PROBABLY obsolete below v 

%To verify the participation count for a protest \(\prtst\)  with identifier $\cid$
%(see \cref{DefProtest}), a verifier must download all the proof shares \[
%  \psh_i =   (\cid, \pid_j, \wid_i, t_s^{(i)}, t_s^{\prime (i)}, t_e^{(i)}, 
%  t_e^{\prime   (i)}, l_i, \corr_{\pid_j}^{(i)}, \corr_{\wid_i})
%\] for each protester \(j\) from the ledger, verify \(\corr_{\pid_j}^{(i)}\), 
%\(\corr_{\wid_i}\) and that the interval \(\interval{\max(t_s^{(i)}, 
%    t_s^{\prime (i)})}{\min(t_e^{(i)}, t_e^{\prime (i)})}\subseteq t\) and that 
%\(l_i\subseteq  l\).
%Any proof share that does not verify correctly will be discarded.
%At this point, the verifier has constructed the set \(S\) from 
%\cref{DefProofShares} and can thus construct any participation proof 
%\(\prf_{\pid_j, P}\) as in \cref{DefParticipationProof}.
%Now the verifier can compute the participation count \(|\prfs_P^{\str, 
%    \theta}|\) as in \cref{DefParticipationCount}.


%__________________________

% In the case \emph{without} trusted witnesses, all the weights equal to 1 is equivalent to counting the elements in the set, 
% \(\str[\prf_{\pid_j, P}] = |\prf_{\pid_j, P}|\).

In the case of trusted witnesses, each such trusted witness must
publish or otherwise inform the 
verifier of which proof shares they have signed, \eg by giving a list 
of all such proof shares or digitally signing each proof share\footnote{
 To achieve witness privacy in this situation, one could employ a group or 
 ring signature scheme for all trusted witnesses.
 Then one learns that at least one trusted witness must have been there.
}.

Note that, thanks to the \((\str,\theta)\)-eligibility criterion (\cref{DefParticipationCount}), the method of counting is extremely generic, and each verifier can make an independent choice to regulate their trust in the final result, based on their initial trust in the witnesses. In other words, anyone who does the counting can choose the eligibility
criteria (time interval, location, number of regular or trusted
witnesses, who is considered to be a trusted witness) for their own count
and as long as these are published along with the result, anyone can
verify the correctness of the count under those criteria, and potentially question the validity of this choice. Biased or partisan verifiers may be tempted to make extreme choices, but they will have to publish those choices and lose credibility. Reasonable verifiers on the other hand will try to find a good middle-ground that counts all legitimate protesters while being resistant to isolated malicious agents.

% Then the verifier can define \[
%   \str[\prf_{\pid_j, P}] = \begin{cases}
%     1 & \text{if \(\exists \psh_i\in \prf_{\pid_j, P}\) that is such a proof 
%       share} \\
%     0 & \text{otherwise}
%   \end{cases}
% \] and sets \(\theta = 1\).
