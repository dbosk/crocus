  could be used for any location   proofs that do not 
  need to identify the prover and thus could make 
  even notorio  usly invasive mechanisms such as 
  location-based services privacy-preserving. The  re 
  is, however, no secure distance-bounding protocol 
  for general attribute-based   anonymous 
  credentials. Brands and Chaum's (EUROCRYPT'93) 
  protocol combining dis  tance-bounding and Schnorr 
  identification comes close, but does not fulfill 
  the   requirements of modern distance-bounding 
  protocols. For that, we need a secure d  
  istance-bounding zero-knowledge proof-of-knowledge 
  resisting mafia fraud, distan  ce fraud, distance 
  hijacking and terrorist fraud.",
