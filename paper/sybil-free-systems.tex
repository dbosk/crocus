\label{sybil-free-systems}

Our Sybil-free pseudonym system is very similar to that of 
\textcite{SybilFreePseudonyms}.
Both are based on the work of \textcite{HowToWinTheCloneWars}.
We make the same simplification of~\cite{HowToWinTheCloneWars} as 
\textcite{SybilFreePseudonyms}, but we also require an interactive version.
Furthermore, our \acp{PK} must be distance bounding.
