%@sbuc: Can you write a few words about MANETs (file MANETs.tex)?
%More specifically, why we can assume there is a way for the
%protesters to communicate locally at the protest without relying on the
%Internet. Also mention potential privacy problems at this layer, e.g.\
%MAC-address tracking etc. which is outside of our protocol (this should
%cover part of issue #58).

Since the cellular network could be shut down to keep protesters from accessing the Internet, making phone calls or texting, we require a different means of communications between protesters. 
This could be accomplished by Bluetooth or WiFi communications, as demonstrated by Briar~\cite{Briar} and FireChat~\cite{FireChat}, two examples of applications for communication during protests via wireless mesh networking. The crowd-counting scenario likely has higher requirements on capacity and withstanding interference as the participants continuously run the protocol for witnessing each others presence; messages are presumably less frequent. 5G is intended to cope with billions of devices (IoT), and thus could help cope with the device density in crowds.
An alternative, although originally designed to work within 5G cellular networks, is device-to-device communication (D2D)~\cite{D2D}. 
Specifically, the out-of-band and autonomous version D2D fits our scenario thanks to using unlicensed spectrum and working without cellular coverage.
