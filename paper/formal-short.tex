\section{Formal Verification}\label{formal-verification}

We formally verify the distance-bounding protocol security properties using the Tamarin
prover~\cite{meier2013tamarin}. Tamarin does not originally include
the possibility to reason on time and space in its model.  However,
thanks to a recent work by \textcite{TamarinDB}, the common properties
(mafia fraud, and distance fraud/distance hi-jacking) can be equivalently 
characterized with a causality-based definition relying only on the order
of messages.
Another work by the same team \textcite{TamarinDBTF} also introduces a
notion of post-collusion security that can be used to partially automate
proofs regarding terrorist fraud, provided a manual proof of a least-disclosing
message needed for collusion.
We have successfully verified all the protocols presented in this paper with 
Tamarin.
More details can be found in \cref{formal-verification-full}.
