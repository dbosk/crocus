\section{Conclusions}

In general, none of the related works fulfils the eligibility verifiability 
\cref{%
  CountOnce,%
  CreatedAfterStart,CreatedBeforeEnd,SpatiallyRelated,%
}.
To some extent, some techniques do fulfil \cref{DesignatedEvent}, since people 
usually use placards in the protests.
Also, some schemes provide universal verifiability (\cref{UniversalVerif}), but 
not individual verifiability (\cref{IndividualVerif}).
If they would provide individual verifiability, they would likely violate the 
privacy requirements.
And finally, most of the current methods are estimates, with quite some error 
margins.
