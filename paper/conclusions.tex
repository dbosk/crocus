In this paper, we have adapted the Schnorr protocol as a
distance-bounding protocol.  It allows to construct distance-bounding
general attribute-based authentication, more general attributes than
provided by previous \ac{DB} ones.  With our contribution, Alice can
now prove more complex statements to Bob; \eg that she is older than
18 but younger than 40 without revealing her actual age, and at the
same time Bob can be sure that Alice is not just relaying messages
from her older sister Carol.
