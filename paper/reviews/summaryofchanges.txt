We clarified and elaborated on identity assumptions throughout the
paper, in the introduction, system model, security analysis, and
discussion. While we provide some suggestions on how the identity
provision could be done in a suitable way, the details are out of
scope and we point to voting as a comparable area that advances
despite imperfect realizations of identity assumptions.

>protocols

Distance-bounding protocols exist, some even very close to what we need: we
only need one with particular properties due to our choice of anonymous
credentials. We mentioned two possible avenues of adapting existing DB
protocols to our needs. We have been working on one of them with
promising results (but not yet fully conclusive verification and have
thus not published or included it here). 

> while leaving existing primitives like functional encryption out of
>  the model.
We have now included a more complete  description of distance-bounding protocols in the Building Blocks section, explicitly addressing functional encryption and how it does
not help the adversary given terrorist-fraud resistant distance bounding.

>Furthermore, the reviewers felt that the paper should assume a more hostile

We have edited our adversary model, clarified the government problem,
improved our security analysis, and added to the discussion.

>In particular, the authors should protect against adversary model A2
> and avoid
We only have one attacker now for clarity. A2 was a global passive
adversary. We do not agree that protecting against a global passive
adversary is a pre-requisite for publishing a paper that contains any
kind of Internet communications. We changed the adversary model,
security analysis, and discussion accordingly.

>vulnerabilities even when a large portion of the witnesses is
 malicious.

We improved the adversary model, security analysis, and discussion to
that end. 

>We hope that these comments will help the authors improve the paper towards
>future acceptance.
We thank the reviewers for the constructive comments that helped us
see where we needed to improve the paper. While we disagree with what
we perceived as quite categorical requirements (the one regarding identity
provision potentially boiling down to saying one cannot assume a trusted third
party for something because it could turn out to be not trustworthy
and one about global adversary resistance), we have made substantial
changes to the paper throughout based on the reviewers' feedback.
