----- TEXT:
CROCUS proposes a new scheme for counting the exact number of anonymous
people who attend any event such as a protest, a strike or an election
with preventing any tuning, i.e. double-counting or undercounting the
number of participants. This proposed system can be transparent to
prove that count has been accomplished correctly, preserving the data
privacy (pseudonymity/linkability of protester, protest, and witness
to any proof), and secure against the potential attacks. Moreover,
CROUS supports smartphones’ decentralized framework and in this paper,
each participant is assumed having a smartphone and a digital identity
certificate that has been proved by a certificate authority.

CROCUS makes use of the building blocks: zero-knowledge proof (Camenisch
and Stadler notation and Fiat-Shamir heuristic for signature), some
existing solutions for the anonymous credential, the distance-bounding
protocol to prevent relay attacks.  The proposed verifiable counting
solution seems correct and the adversarial setting is improved compared
to previous work. Moreover, this scheme seems to provide precision on the
total participants’ number. On the other hand, the following aspects
remain unclear:

-	This scheme is not implemented using a smartphone although
the title of the work contains the words “using smartphones”
and further the benchmark values seem to originate from the old
implementations not belonging to the author/authors. It seems that
this scheme cannot be implemented because of today’s technology
since some restrictions for signing the identity credential by CA,
distance-bounding protocols, etc. on the smartphone exist. It is not
fair to use “using smartphones” in the title even if this will be
considered as future work.

-	How is the relation of a protest and a protester defined, and
which method is used for it?

-	For pseudonyms of protester and witness, what is the percentage
of not having the same pseudonym (it is written as the negligible
probability)?

-	For the adversarial model, what is the function f and d exactly?

-	In the same section (4.3), is “The adversary only learns the
protocol data …” also information leakage to the adversary other
than the identity of protester and/or witness?

-	In anonymous credentials, defining the values are sufficient to
understand since they are mentioned before, but what they are discovered
later.

-	In section 6, protocol functions should be explained more to
make the reader understand the CROUS. Besides, some functions using hash
functions or PRF should be explained. For generating t_e, is the same
hash function for cid used?

-	The author(s) wrote that the system is decentralized on the
smartphones in the abstract; however, this is not discussed in any
sections in the paper. Moreover, although obviously, this scheme cannot
be implemented in today’s technology, it is claimed that this scheme
can provide an acceptable performance of the distance-bounding protocols
on smartphones.

Detailed comments -	  There is a missing reference on page 1 in
the last paragraph: “… We compare it to related work in ??.” -
On page 2 in the last paragraph, there are two “CrowdCount”s.  -
There are some overflows of the column’s margin on pages 4, 5, and 13.
-	For figures 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, if they are mentioned in the
sections, they should be mentioned that they are in the Appendix.

----- TEXT:
This paper presents a decentralised system based on smartphones for
privacy-preserving and verifiable crowd counting. The system achieves
properties similar to those needed for electronic voting where it is
important to count everyone, but only once, there is not leak of private
information and it is possible  to prove that the count is correct.

The paper is interesting but is based on some assumptions that in specific
situations are not realisable. However, the limitations are addressed
explicitly in specific section dedicated to a discussion of what is
necessary for a complete implementation. Since there are some aspects
that cannot be implemented I cannot understand hoe authors discuss the
"acceptable performance" of the system.

The introduction of this paper does not provide any overall description
of the proposal. The abstract is more informative with respect to the
introduction. My suggestion is to improve the introduction declaring
the contribution and limitations.

Protocol functions in Sec.6 are not easy to read. Authors should make
them more readable with a deep explanation.

This paper in the platform is indicated as short paper but covers a
number of pages dedicated to full papers.  In the paper there are some
problems in referring the related work section: "We compare it to related
work in ??."

----- TEXT:
The paper proposes a system for privately counting the participants
attending a rally. It combines anonymous credentials and blind signatures
to allow "witnesses" give proofs that a "participant" was present,
without leaking the identity of the witness nor the participant, nor
making them linkable across rallies.

I have numerous problems with this paper:

*. the problem is definitely a significant one, if the crowd estimates put
out by different sides start differing by orders of magnitude. However, I
feel that counting everybody one-by-one is perhaps not the most efficient
way to arrive at a mutually agreeable number.

*. The paper was difficult to follow: used primitives, as well as proposed
protocols were not fully specified in the paper. I still cannot quite tell
whether the witnesses were expected to remain anonymous or not. If they're
anonymous, then how can I tell how trustworthy they are in my opinion?

*. The eID infrastructure required by a deployment would most likely be
provided by the entity against which the system is trying to protect.

*. The devices required to run the protocol are not yet available.

*. There is no report of an implementation.
