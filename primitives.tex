\subsection{Zero-knowledge proofs}

Briefly describe zero-knowledge proofs and what type of properties can be proved 
efficiently using them, e.g.\ algebraic structures but not one-way functions.

\dots

\subsection{Location proofs and distance bounding}

Briefly describe location proofs and distance bounding protocols.
Describe the different desirable properties for distance bounding:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mafia-fraud resistance,
  \item terrorist-fraud resistance,
  \item impersonation-fraud resistance,
  \item distance-fraud resistance.
\end{itemize}
