  \begin{question}
    Shall we offer a platform that is run by a variety of institutions who 
    offers to verify protests?
    Or go strictly peer-to-peer?
  \end{question}
  \begin{question}
    If strictly peer-to-peer, and only run by protesters, one can infer that 
    they are protesters by running such a node.
    Can this be mitigated?
  \end{question}
