        This picture was posted on Twitter (and linked from Reddit) to argue

          news} and that Trump's supporters arrived later.
        Even if the picture labelled \enquote{REALITY} would be from the same 
        event (difficult to verify), it is difficult to accurately compare due 
        to the angle.

        \item Provides privacy based on anonymous credentials and 
          privacy-preserving proximity testing.
        \item Requires only local connectivity during the protest.
        \item Requires no trust in the source (as in \cref{TrumpInauguration}), 
          only that IDs are issued correctly.

        key \(\sk_W\) and \(\pid\).
        \(t_s, t_s'\) are the last heads of the blockchain seen by the 
        protester and witness, respectively, and \(l\) is an area.
        All values are signed by the witness while also proving the correctness 
        of \(\wid\) and knowledge of a signature on \(\sk_W\).
